### Hello World!

I run the Tech for Social Good program on the GitHub [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.github.com) team. Previous to joining GitHub in April 2019, I worked in tech for international development (ICT4D) as a UX researcher and designer, mostly for the United Nations. 

I don't use this repo much, as you can probably tell. If you're curious about my work, you can read more [on my website](https://malakumar.com). At any given time, it's like 78% updated. I made that number up.
