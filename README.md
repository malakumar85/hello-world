### Hello World! ###

My name is Mala, and apparently, I started a repo in 2016 that contained precisely one read.me file. The content was quite outdated, which naturally spurred me to write something relevant to my current life.

In April 2019, I joined GitHub as their Program Manager, Open Source for Good with the Social Impact team. Prior to GitHub, I worked for a decade in technology for international development (ICT4D) on programmatic areas including public health and food security. In ICT4D, I worked for many years as a project manager, UX researcher and designer, and a thought leadership author in both English and French. My work has taken me throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and New York City.

Outside of work, one of my biggest accomplishments is getting my novel *The Paths of Marriage* published in October 2014.

Through a mix of hard work and luck, the novel sold around the world and solidly surfaced on the radar of a few major international publications. I did a US east coast book tour in early 2015.
